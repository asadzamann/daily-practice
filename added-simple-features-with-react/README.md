##What is UseState and How does it work?

Answer: UseState is a react hook, you can use it to show and and update efficiently.
It takes two varible first one is use to show data and other one used to update the data.
For instance, 
const [count, setcount] = useState(0)
Here, default value of count is zero, because we used 0 in the useState brackets, setCount is the updated value you put. then it will show in count.
